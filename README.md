# MiniGameMakingChallenge
Unity Game Making Challenge for less than 1 Day. This Project will be a Cumulative Repository to get an actual game making ability, Making weekly routine for study and future prototypes. 

## Prerequisites
Unity Latest Version 2018.3.0f2

## Description

Simple Description about Challenges. but hardly say these challenges are game.

### Challenge Kit 

General purpose library to support projects.
 - Singleton Pattern, csv Table Handler, Board Interaction, Object Pooling, Message Pattern.

### 1) Pay Tax

2D Board Generation, Event handling, Simple collecting game rule based on the coroutine, Simple object pooling.

### 2) YouNamSeng

Csv parsing, Dialog system with simple interaction, Testing about TextMeshPro Korean fonts.

### 3) SelectToBeAlive

Scenario System, Sample case for using scriptable Object, Dialog select module, Simple message system.

### 4) MinAvgSliceIndex

Heavily relied on the message system to construct most of game routine. 
Round based gameplay to find most minimum average slice index. not fun at all.
So... nothing new. -_-;;

## Future

private GitHub projects for making actual simple free game to publish android market. Learning for entire game making cycle.
I mean, really game, not just like these simple library samples.
