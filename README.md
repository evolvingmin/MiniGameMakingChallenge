Havily relied on the message system to construct most of game routine. 
Round based gameplay to find most minimum avarage slice index. not fun at all.
So... nothing new. -_-;;

## Future Plan

public github projects for making actual simple free game to publish android market. Learning for entire game making cycle.
I mean, really game, not just like these simple library samples.
